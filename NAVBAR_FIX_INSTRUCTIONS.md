# Navbar User Name Fix

## What Was Fixed

1. **Updated Navbar.jsx** - Changed from showing just "Hi!" to "Hi, {user?.name || 'User'}!"
2. **Enhanced AuthContext** - Added proper user data persistence in localStorage
3. **Added Debug Logging** - Console logs to help troubleshoot auth state

## How to Test the Fix

### Method 1: Register a New User
1. Start both backend and frontend servers
2. Go to `/auth` page
3. Click "Sign Up" tab
4. Fill in the form with:
   - Name: "John Doe" (or any name)
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Password: "password123"
   - Confirm password and check terms
5. Click "Sign Up"
6. You should be redirected to home page
7. Check navbar - should show "Hi, John Doe!"

### Method 2: Login with Existing User
1. Go to `/auth` page
2. Use login tab with any existing user credentials
3. After successful login, navbar should show the user's name

### Method 3: Check Browser Storage
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application/Storage tab
3. Check localStorage - should see:
   - `token`: JWT token
   - `user`: User object with name, email, etc.

## Debug Information

The navbar now includes console logs. Check browser console for:
- `Navbar - isAuthenticated: true/false`
- `Navbar - user: {name: "John Doe", email: "..."}`

## If Name Still Not Showing

1. **Clear Browser Storage**:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   ```

2. **Check Console for Errors** - Look for any authentication errors

3. **Verify Backend Connection** - Make sure backend is running on port 5001

4. **Test API Manually**:
   - Register/login through frontend
   - Check if token is stored in localStorage
   - Verify `/api/auth/me` endpoint works with the token

## Expected Behavior

After login/registration:
- Navbar shows: "Hi, [User Name]!" instead of just "Hi!"
- User data persists across page refreshes
- Logout clears the user name

The fix ensures user data is properly stored and retrieved from localStorage, making the name persistent across browser sessions.
